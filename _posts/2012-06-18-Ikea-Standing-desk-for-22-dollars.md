I've been interested in standing desks for a while. I keep reading
things like: [he who sits the
most dies the
soonest](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/confirmed-he-who-sits-the-most-dies-the-soonest/256101/).
All the options online are expensive. Until now.  [Ryan Witt from Decisive](http://decisive.is/) and I combined our brains to see if we could come up with a better solution:

## Introducing The Standesk 2200

It's a cheap solution made from Ikea parts for as low as $22. And you
just put it on top of your existing desk.

## What do you want from a standing desk?

Ergonomics are pretty simple. You want your set up to look like this:

[Go check out the full article on tinkering monkey](http://blog.tinkeringmonkey.com/do-your-back-a-favor-get-a-standing-desk/). They even make standing desks.

There are really 2 parts of this: *monitor height* and *keyboard height*.
The key thing is: you don't want your monitor and keyboard to be on the same surface. You'll get neck cramps, or cut off blood circulation to your fingers.

## Building a standing desk on a regular desk

When you're working in a coworking space (we're in [General Assembly in New York](http://generalassemb.ly)) or in a regular office, the friction to go from sitting to standing is usually high:

* The cheapest adjustable standing desks are around $800 (geekdesk)
* You already have an existing desk in your workspace
* Your boss would rather you die in your chair than live on your feet

[Marco Arment](http://marco.org) while working at Tumblr built his standing desk from stacking cans of soda [stacking
cans](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcoarment/3234209861/).
Ryan and I did it with parts from Ikea for $22 (+ tax)

## So, what's the recipe?

* [Lack side table](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20011413/#/20011408) - $7.99
* [Viktor Shelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20167961/) - $5.99
* [Ekby Valter bracket](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/56696109/#/80167473) $4.00 x 2
* Screws from home: free.
* **Total cost: $21.98**

Note: Make sure you get an 11 inch shelf + 11 inch brackets. This means
you don't need to screw in the shelf to the bracket (unless you want
to).

## Assembly Instructions

[![Standesk Assembly Instructions](https://img.skitch.com/20120620-d62cqnaggds35ww5du4hurhuef.png)](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Standesk_2200_Assembly_Instructions.pdf)

As requested by [Jonathan

## Who's using this design?

Hundreds and hundreds of people have posted their build pictures on twitter, in the comments, and online. If you build it please share your pics!

## The deluxe

Consider getting yourself another Lack Side Table ($7.99) to double the surface
area for your monitor. This option gives you space for a laptop stand.

Also consider the [Dioder LED set](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50192365/) ($39.99) to add some color to your desk. It gives it that lowrider feel. Though be wary, that *the LED lights are more expensive than the entire standing desk*.

## What about you?

Have you built an amazing standing desk? Email me colin at customer dot
io, or add it in the comments here. I want to see it. Have you made
improvements on this design? Let me know too.
