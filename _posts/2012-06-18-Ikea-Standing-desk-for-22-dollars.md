I've been interested in standing desks for a while. I keep reading
things like: [he who sits the
most dies the
soonest](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/confirmed-he-who-sits-the-most-dies-the-soonest/256101/).
All the options online are expensive. Until now.  [Ryan of Opani, our deskmate who does amazing big data analytics](http://opani.com) and I combined our brains to see if we could come up with a better solution:

## Introducing The Standesk 2200

It's a cheap solution made from Ikea parts for as low as $22. And you
just put it on top of your existing desk.

## What do you want from a standing desk?

Ergonomics are pretty simple. You want your set up to look like this:

[Go check out the full article on tinkering monkey](http://www.tinkeringmonkey.com/site/do-your-back-a-favor-get-a-standing-desk/). They even make standing desks.

There are really 2 parts of this: *monitor height* and *keyboard height*.
The key thing is: you don't want your monitor and keyboard to be on the same surface. You'll get neck cramps, or cut off blood circulation to your fingers.

## Building a standing desk on a regular desk

When you're working in a coworking space or in a regular office, the friction to go from sitting to standing is high:

* The cheapest adjustable standing desks are around $800 (geekdesk)
* You already have an existing desk in your workspace
* Your boss would rather you die in your chair than live on your feet

[Marco Arment](http://marco.org) while working at Tumblr built his standing desk from stacking cans of soda [stacking
cans](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcoarment/3234209861/).
Ryan and I did it with parts from Ikea for $22 (+ tax)

## So, what's the recipe?

* [Lack side table](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20011413/#/20011408) - $7.99
* [Viktor Shelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20167961/) - $5.99
* [Ekby Valter bracket](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/56696109/#/80167473) $4.00 x 2
* Screws from home: free.
* **Total cost: $21.98**

Note: Make sure you get an 11 inch shelf + 11 inch brackets. This means
you don't need to screw in the mount to the bracket.

## Who's using this design?

A few people so far:

* Colin & John from [Customer.io](http://customer.io)
* Ryan from [Opani](http://opani.com)
* Joel & Matt from [Acquaintable](http://acquaintable.com)
* Saikat from [Stripe](http://stripe.com)

If you end up building it, let me know in the comments.

## The deluxe

Consider getting yourself another Lack Side Table ($7.99) to double the surface
area for your monitor. This option gives you space for a laptop stand.

Also consider the [Dioder LED set](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50192365/) ($39.99) to add some color to your desk. It gives it that lowrider feel. Though be wary, that *the LED lights are more expensive than the entire standing desk*.

## In summary

This is a phenomenal desk setup. After Ryan and I figured this out,
there are 4 other people who have bought the parts to make their own
desks. 

Have you built an amazing standing desk? Email me colin at customer dot
io, or add it in the comments here. I want to see it. Have you made
improvements on this design? Let me know too.
