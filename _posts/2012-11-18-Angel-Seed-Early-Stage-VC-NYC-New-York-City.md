title: "Early Stage Investors in NYC - Angels, Seed and VCs"

Surprisingly, one of the hard things with raising a round is figuring out who to pitch. Here are a few rules of thumb for the amount of money you'll receive:

* Angel: $25,000 - 50,000 investment
* Seed: $100,000 - $250,000 investment
* VC (Early Stage): $200,000 - $1mm investment

Most of the time when you see lists of people who have done early stage deals, the important information is missing (are they an angel, seed fund or vc?). Basically, if you try to raise venture money too early, or when it isn't appropriate for your business, you'll spend some valuable time you can't get back.

The requirements of each investor type are different and those conversations may skew your thinking about your business. Angels can be successful with different outcomes than Seed and VC investors. A couple of things to consider:

1. VCs and most Seed funds value growth over profitability.
1. VC and seed investments are often institutional money, not personal wealth.
1. VC and seed investments often have a time-horizon they expect a return.
1. Angels may be happy with a $5mm acquisition whereas a VC probably wouldn't.

If you're starting a business that may never IPO and might max out at a healthy $10 - 50mm a year business, many VCs (even early stage VCs) won't be interested. If they are, they'll likely encourage you to pursue something they would consider a larger opportunity.

Now that you want to talk to people about your deal, here are a list of people I got from Business Insider. I added 1 person to make it 101 New York City Early Stage investors.

I'm trying an experiment. So if you want to add new people or additional info about the folks on here, feel free:
