# Wearing a uniform

Steve Jobs is one of the best known people for wearing the same thing every day. He'd do Apple's keynotes and work every day in his iconic black turtleneck, jeans and new balance sneakers.

[Many others](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45klli/mark-zuckerberg/) favor a daily uniform. 

In the startup world, it's easy to default to wearing free shirts from other startups + jeans pretty much every day. That look has become such a part of the culture, that there are a few articles on the web making fun of it.

Sticking to a routine in some parts of your life (like what to wear) lets you dedicate your energy to other parts. Sheena Iyengar in her Ted talk talks about a survey she did that found that [the average person makes 70 choices in a typical day](http://www.ted.com/talks/sheena_iyengar_choosing_what_to_choose#t-80637).  
But as I get older showing up every day in a t-shirt with some dot-com logo no longer seems appealing. 

So, I'm trying a new daily uniform:

A v-neck shirt (with no logo)
Jeans
Vans shoes

What do you think? Have you tried a daily uniform? Do you think the whole idea of wearing the same thing every day is ridiculous?
