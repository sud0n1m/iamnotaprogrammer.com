Anyone who programs a lot probably has keyboard shortcuts memorized. After a while, you don't think about it, it's just muscle memory. (This may not the technical term)

I try to make as much as possible accessible by muscle memory. When I was a kid, telephone numbers went in there. Now, it's my atm code, passwords, where I keep my metrocard in my wallet. The more you can make consistent and reliable, the less you have to think when doing it.

I was trying to figure out why I can't remember my pin for online banking. It's because the primary mode of entry is to click the buttons with a mouse. Take a look:

When I have something in my muscle memory, there's usually a visual trigger, like a website logo, or an ATM keypad, or an elevator panel. I don't need to think, I just do it. Clicking on a target that may not always be in the same place with a mouse isn't something I can map to my brain as a repeatable pattern. And as such, it totally fails. I need to keep my pin handy so that *every* time I log in, I refer to that code. Fwiw, that code is unique to the site and I only use it there.

Preventing keyboard input is a security concern. It could be picked up by a keystroke logger. But the alternative is that an unsophisticated user writes it down on a sticky note on their monitor rather than being able to memorize it. I sure can't.
