Anyone who programs a lot probably has keyboard shortcuts memorized. After a while, you don't think about it, it's just muscle memory. (This may not the technical term)

I try to make as much as possible accessible by muscle memory. When I was a kid, telephone numbers went in there. Now, it's my atm code, passwords, which pocket I keep my wallet in, and even where I keep my metrocard in my wallet. 

The more things in your life that are consistent and reliable, the less you have to think when getting stuff done.

## Hunt and click only

I was trying to figure out why I can't remember my pin for online banking. I decided it's because the primary mode of entry is to click the buttons with a mouse. Take a look:

## How muscle memory works for me

When I have something in my muscle memory, there's usually a visual trigger, like a website logo, or an ATM keypad, or an elevator panel. *I don't need to think*, I just do it. Clicking on a variable target with a mouse isn't something I can map to my brain as a pattern there's nothing memorizable about it. And as such, it fails / I fail. I need to refer to my pin *every* time I log in. (Fwiw, that code is unique to the site and I only use it there).

Preventing keyboard input is a security concern. It could be picked up by a keystroke logger. But the alternative is that an unsophisticated user writes it down on a sticky note on their monitor rather than being able to memorize it. I sure can't.
