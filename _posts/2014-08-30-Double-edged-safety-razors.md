description: An introduction to shaving with a double edged safety razor

Around the time the Mach 3 came out, I started ignoring advancements in razor technology. The latest thing from Gillette looks like Dyson vacuum for your face. There's a big roller ball in case your wrist is unable to rotate, and there's even a battery inside that presumably causes it to vibrate because... why not?

Buying replacement blades for an aging Mach 3 was the path I chose to take as generation and generation of new razor would come out, refusing to needlessly upgrade to the latest and greatest. 

A couple of years ago, a friend of mine turned me on to shaving with a double-edged safety razor. Since then I've discovered there's a [thriving community on reddit for people who shave with straight or doubled-edged razors](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/). 

The double-edged safety razor design was actually invented by Gillette in 1901 and the company was awarded a patent in 1904. Gillette got a contract to supply the US troops in World War I which brought that style of razor in to common use ([via Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_razor)). These days there are lots of companies manufacturing both the handles and blades. No more patents mean no more vendor lock-in. Gillette to presumably keep a stream of revenue has gone off the deep end iterating on a solutions that already do the job really really well. 

Competition on the now generic double edged safety razor has driven down cost that you can get replacement blades for about [$0.10 a blade](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SGKMA0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004SGKMA0&linkCode=as2&tag=onmacnet-20&linkId=GP5OPAGVY72FQ5G3).

A [chrome-finished handle is about $30](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002A8JO48/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002A8JO48&linkCode=as2&tag=onmacnet-20&linkId=UAQSAD7ZXQEULN4U).

Compare that with Gillette Fusion Proglide Power. [$11.47 for the handle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J3MPS4E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00J3MPS4E&linkCode=as2&tag=onmacnet-20&linkId=MX4O5WQRBXQDQ2WS). Then the blades are about [$4.25 per blade](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EMXLIE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003EMXLIE&linkCode=as2&tag=onmacnet-20&linkId=CEYZU3YY6D4W3F26). *Hint: They make the money on the blades!*

Shaving with a straight razor is a bit more up front, but in the long run you won't need to replace the handle (ever?). 

One thing I noticed the Merkur handle does differently is slightly curving the blade using some pressure from the razor. This makes for a really great shave that is hard to nick / cut yourself.

There's no more satisfying way to shave than putting a heavy piece of metal against your face with a big ass blade in there and shaving off some unwanted facial hair.
