Last night I asked twitter what startup founders do to unwind:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Startup founders: What do you do to unwind? I started gaming about a year ago and just got an acoustic guitar. What works for you?</p>&mdash; Colin Nederkoorn (@alphacolin) <a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin/statuses/426120093043408897">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

Here are some of the responses, and a summary of what people said and things I've been doing.

## Watch TV

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin">@alphacolin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne">@joelgascoigne</a> Watching Big Bang Theory (previously Friends) - instant unwind, brain switches off.</p>&mdash; Daniel Tenner (@swombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/swombat/statuses/426121520847781888">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

I really need something like that.                           Sometimes if I work until 10 or 11, I struggle to rest my brain before getting in bed and can't fall asleep. Recently I've been watching "Vikings" to switch off my brain.  

I have a feeling TV is a popular one because it's so easy to just plop yourself on the couch and watch a show.

If you haven't got anything, here are a few series I've loved recently:

* Sherlock (BBC series)
* House of Cards (Netflix)
* Under the Dome (bad, but watchable)
* Game of Thrones (a little obvious) 

## Play a video game

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin">@alphacolin</a> Gaming typically. I play about 15-30 min of Quake most nights just before bed (Q2 DM). Keeps me sharp!</p>&mdash; Chad Keck (@ckeck) <a href="https://twitter.com/ckeck/statuses/426123189651898369">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

I started gaming about a year ago and found that on the weekend, spending a day enveloped in a game was a great way to unwind. I'm not a "good" gamer, so serious FPS or MMORPG games don't really appeal. I want something more casual that doesn't need a lot of built up skill to play.

I built a little steam box and have ended up buying more games than I play. 

Recently, I've been playing:

* Team Fortress 2
* Left 4 Dead 2

Other games I really enjoyed

* Borderlands 2
* The Walking Dead
* Bioshock Infinite
* Portal 2
* Kerbal Space Program
* FTL

## Do some exercise

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin">@alphacolin</a> I run. Running just clears my mind and it always works like a reboot for me.</p>&mdash; Nikolaj Astrup (@nikolajam) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikolajam/statuses/426121933352996864">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

* Hiking
* Running
* Going to the gym
* Biking

A lot of people mentioned exercise as a key part of what they do. Doing it feels amazing, but it's easy to fall in to a slump (especially in the winter in NY).

I've found that spending the extra cash to get locker and laundry service at a gym walking distance from work gives me no excuse to just walk over there and get in a workout at lunch. So far I'm up to twice this week and hoping to get to three times a week.

A great option for people who don't like to work out is a "Multi-vitamin hobby" (I love that term). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin">@alphacolin</a> Find a &quot;multi-vitamin&quot; hobby. Mine is salsa dancing. It&#39;s got music, exercise, learning new things, socializing and creativity.</p>&mdash; Logan Volkers (@logvol) <a href="https://twitter.com/logvol/statuses/426128463389413377">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

## Do something creative

A lot of startup founders (especially product focused founders) seem to have some kind of art outlet.

For me it's playing guitar. I stopped playing guitar regularly about 6 years ago, but recently picked it up again. After reading extensively on reddit and elsewhere I bought a [Seagull S6 acoustic guitar](http://reverb.com/item/48163-seagull-s6-mahogany-deluxe-mahogany). Last night I started learning ["Snow" by Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://tunessence.com/tabs/red-hot-chili-peppers/snow-). Guitar sites have come a long way since I last checked out tabs online. 

## Cook a meal

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin">@alphacolin</a> Not work more than 30 hours a week; hanging out with people, reading, watching old TV series, gaming, cooking. :)</p>&mdash; Thomas Fuchs (@thomasfuchs) <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/statuses/426120605935882240">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I usually cook at home. I put on a few pounds over the holidays and decided to try a ["Ketogenic diet"](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto) for a while (basically removing starchy carbs). After a few weeks I've noticed I don't get "hangry" anymore and my mood is generally more stable. 

In general, I've always enjoyed cooking, and we had [Blue Apron](http://blueapron.com) for about a year and got 3 meals a week we didn't have to think about. 

## Read a books

Books are a great way to relax. I usually get in to a book when going off the grid for a weekend. 

I usually read fiction over business books otherwise it feels like work.

Here are a few I've loved recently:

* 11/22/63 - Stephen King
* The ender series - Orson Scott Card
* The Walking Dead (graphic novel) - Robert Kirkman
* The Hunger Games series - Suzanne Collins
* The Game of Throne series - George R.R. Martin


## Go off the grid to relax or meditate

Out of the topic areas above you could probably pick and choose which thing is for you. 

The one thing I've heard from *so* many founders and experienced myself is that sometimes you just need to turn everything off and tune out for a weekend. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin">@alphacolin</a> A walk is always good.. and taking weekends off to relax and rejuvenate. <a href="https://twitter.com/HotelTonight">@HotelTonight</a> is awesome for impromtpu mini-vacays</p>&mdash; Alex Shye (@alexshye) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexshye/statuses/426122575521914880">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

For my birthday I got a trip to a [B&B in Hudson NY](http://www.mountmerinomanor.com/). It was fantastic and I felt like the time away did me a world of good.

Building in some meditation in to daily life seems to do wonders for the people who do it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alphacolin">@alphacolin</a> Yeah, have done meditation on and off in the past. Headspace has been helpful: <a href="http://t.co/OA2OASTe9S">http://t.co/OA2OASTe9S</a></p>&mdash; Ruben Gamez (@earthlingworks) <a href="https://twitter.com/earthlingworks/statuses/426124766563422208">January 22, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm giving meditation a try. I'm one day in to my 10 day trial so I can't speak to it yet.

I hope you enjoyed this compilation of the feedback that people gave. I posted the [full list of comments on Storify](http://storify.com/alphacolin/what-do-startup-founders-do-to-unwind/).

If you have anything I missed, let everyone know in the comments.
