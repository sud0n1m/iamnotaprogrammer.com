I just switched my blog to [Spinto](http://spintoapp.com). 
I've been obsessed with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) as a static site generator for websites.
Github is great for hosting Jekyll sites except if you want to do things like use [SASS](sass-lang.com). 

I had been generating my blog locally and pushing it to linode. Now, Spinto takes care of all that. I can either create posts locally in VIM or write in Markdown on Spinto.

The site is extremely new, but Matthew Beale, the creator of Spinto has done a phenomenal job on a first version.
