1. Never make a legally binding personal guarantee in relation to your business
2. Your time and attention are your most valuable resource. People will try to abuse your desire to be courteous in order to steal yours. 
3. Give without expecting anything in return.
4. Breaking News < Analysis & Magazines < Books. If you spend your time keeping up with breaking news, you won't understand topics deeply.
5. Learn just enough so that you can start doing. The quicker you get your hands dirty, the quicker you are to solving a problem.
