So you thought it would be clever to <span style="color: #ff0000;">make</span> <span style="color: #339966;">your</span><span style="color: #ff6600;"> links</span> <span style="color: #ffcc00;">pretty</span>? <strong>Don't do it</strong>! If you're short on time, follow these simple rules:
<ul>
	<li>Unvisited links should be <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underlined</span></li>
	<li>Visited links should be <span style="color: #800080;">purple</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underlined</span></li>
	<li>Active links should be <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underlined
</span></li>
</ul>
Searching for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=links+should+be+blue">links should be blue</a>" turns up enough reading for an afternoon. This is a topic that has been discussed to death, but still isn't widely understood.
<h2>How to break the rules.</h2>
<strong>Breaking the blue link rule without understanding it makes usability a disaster. </strong>

There are a few good places to break the rule though. Navigation, Buttons, Blog Item Headers, or if you're a design and user experience badass. You need to be sure to communicate the right information to your users. A good place to start understanding links is Smashing Magazine's "<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/13/the-definitive-guide-to-styling-web-links/">The Definitive Guide to Styling Web Links</a>"

Rules are meant to be broken, but do it in a way that makes you look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">1337</a> - not like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#n00b">n00b</a>
