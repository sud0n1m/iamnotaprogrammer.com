Yes, it's a tech company, and it's a little nerdy. We're not trying to
be the next facebook, but we are trying to solve a problem that almost
all websites (and businesses) have:

*Getting people to come back*.

I'll be working with a fantastic cofounder, [John
Allison](http://jallison.com) to make it easy to create [automatic customer retention
emails](http://customer.io)

### The short pitch

Emails are the best way to get people back to your site. At every
company I've worked, there have been targeted emails we've wanted to send to
people at _just_ the right time. We'd think of them
in the format:

If `this happens` then `send the customer that email`

I'd rather go to the dentist and have my wisdom teeth pulled again than
try to build 5 triggered emails like that from scratch. They're a pain to create and manage in
your own software, so we're making it easy to manage by using our
software.

Our Startup's Buzzwords: Big Data, Email Marketing, Customer Retention, Lifecycle
Marketing, Drip Marketing, User Retention as a Service.

We're making it easy to build, manage, and measure automatic customer
retention.

### Farewell old friends

Starting April 1st, I'll be leaving ChallengePost after a fantastic 2+
years as Head of Product. We've accomplished some wonderful things in
the past couple of years. We've grown the team from 3 - 14 people.
They're in a great place. I'm confident about the prospects of the team and
the leadership there.

For me, it's on to another adventure. Every time I've taken a risk, whether it was starting the [contest that inspired challengepost](http://winxponmac.com)", [riding my bike across the US](http://bikeacrossthe.us) or moving to New York, I've always ended up in a better place.

I can't wait to see what the rest of 2012 brings. It's going to be a
great year.
