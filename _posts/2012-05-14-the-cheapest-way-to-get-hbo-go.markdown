Whether you've been [trying to watch Game of Thrones](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones) or any number of HBO's awesome shows, one thing is clear: If you don't buy it as part of your cable subscription, you can't buy it.

So, what's the cheapest way to get HBO Go? 

### Verizon Fios TV

    $12.99 (+ 2.99 discount) for basic Verizon FIOS TV
    $16.99 for HBO (50% off for 12 months) = $8.50
    --------------------------------------------------
    $18.50 per month total

The big downside is that in order to get Verizon FIOS TV, you need to schedule an installation and be home all day for them to come. You'll have to use the supplied Actiontec router and keep everything in COAX mode rather than using Ethernet.

Is there a cheaper way to get HBO Go than $18.50 per month?
