Whether you've been [trying to watch Game of Thrones](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones) or any number of HBO's awesome shows, one thing is clear: If you don't buy it as part of your cable subscription, you can't buy it.

So, what's the cheapest way to get HBO Go?

$10 for basic Verizon FIOS TV
$16.99 for HBO (50% off for 12 months) = $8.50.

Total: $18.50 per month.

The big downside is that in order to get Verizon FIOS TV, you need to schedule an installation.

Is there a cheaper way to do it?
