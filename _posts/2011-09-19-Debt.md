People seldom talk openly about their finances. So, here's my net worth from Mint.com from October 2009 until now.

At my worst, I was carrying revolving debt of $9,240 in November 2010.
I've paid all that off, and i ended the month of September with my Net
Worth above nothing and with zero debt.

Even spending modestly living in New York, it is too easy to enter a
"debt spiral". The hardest thing to do but the best thing I ever did was
learn how to say "Sounds fun, but I can't afford to do that so I'll pass".

I turned down numerous casual weekday dinner invitations, ended nights a
little earlier, and didn't go on weekend getaways. It sucks to have to 
say no, but I couldn't keep up financially
with all of the opportunities that were presented to me. 

So my advice from exiting the debt spiral:

Don't be ashamed of your finances and learn to say no. You'll be richer
for it.

If you're in debt, I'd recommend [Ready for Zero](http://readyforzero.com) as the best tool to track your progress and encourage you as you get out of debt. Check out my profile on the [Ready for Zero blog](http://blog.readyforzero.com/2011/09/19/readyforzero-success-profile-colin/).
