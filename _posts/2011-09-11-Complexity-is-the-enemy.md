Entrepreneurs often take a shotgun approach to product design.  For one reason or another, you end up with products trying to solve too many problems straight out of the gate. Products with scopes as wide as the mind can imagine. Products that are jacks of all trades, and masters of none.

When you look at the products that do tremendously well, they often have one mission.

They build simple products where every feature reinforces that mission. Companies like [Github](http://github.com), [Heroku](http://heroku.com), [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com). They aren't necessarily simple technically. The value proposition is simple. The message is simple. All of these support each other to make the user experience simple.

Solve one problem for one user in the best way you can. Grow from there.
