	<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Back in January 2006, I started a challenge to create an open source solution for running <a href="windows-xp-on-the-intel-mac.html">Windows XP on the Intel Mac</a>. <a href="windows-xp-on-the-intel-mac.html">The challenge</a> raised over $13,500 from the crowd, and the problem was solved within a few months. Inspired by the success of this challenge, I left my job in sales and headed to Boston to join the world of startups.</p>
<p>
I got a desk at Betahouse, and ended up working with a variety of startups associated with the coworking space. I moved to New York in fall of 2008 to join as Product Manager at Thrive, a personal finance startup. Thrive was acquired by Lending Tree in February 2009.</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Brandon Kessler started <a href="http://challengepost.com">ChallengePost</a> to aggregate what the world wants and create challenges to make those things happen. Brandon was inspired to start ChallengePost by my original Windows XP on the Intel Mac challenge. I joined the team in February 2010 as the Head of Product. I spend most of my time designing user experiences to help ChallengePost change the world.
