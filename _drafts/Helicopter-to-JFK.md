_6 minutes from Downtown Manhattan to JFK_. That's the promise of helicopter travel. You bypass the traffic crossing manhattan. You bypass the traffic through Brooklyn and Queens and land right at JFK - a short hop from the terminal.

When I saw Gotham Air pop on to the scene a few months ago, I was excited to try it out.  At $215 a trip, Helicopter is 86 times more expensive than the $2.50 subway ride to JFK. However, if you take a cab, it is $52 + tip ($10) and tolls ($8) or around $70, or 3x what a cab would cost. _I'm just considering 1 person traveling to JFK. The cost per person in a cab goes down if you have more people_.

If any city in the world could support a $215 fee just to get to the airport, New York could. I'm actually shocked more people aren't using it. 

## How the mechanics of the service work

The helicopters that Gotham Air uses can fit 6 - 8 passengers with limited luggage. Currently someone requests a flight and they put it on the schedule. Then people can also join that flight. When 4 out of 6 spots are taken, the flight is guaranteed. 

This is crux of the challenge. When I booked, there was a flight to JFK at 7am monday morning with 6 seats available. I reserved one. This was in fact the only flight all of Monday and there were no other possible flights until Thursday. That suggests to me that there's something off here.

## My Helicopter Ride

I booked my trip to JFK on Thursday night. On Saturday night, my flight didn't have enough seats filled and it was canceled. That made me start thinking about the service. What are they doing right? What are they doing wrong?

## What is Gotham Air doing right?

* **The price is good** - $219 is reasonable for business travelers or wealthier individuals. It should save about an hour traveling to JFK and lower stress getting to the airport. Travel time is more predictable. 
* **The model is win-win** - They don't own the helicopters so that gives them lower capital requirements to deliver service. This is also probably a good opportunity to use hardware that might otherwise sit idle. 
* **Decent PR** - There was [good initial PR](http://www.gothamair.com/#!media/c1tzy). Although a bit misleading quoting a $99 promotional rate, the videos I watched did get me excited to try the service.

## What can Gotham Air improve?

* **Actually being "On Demand"** - In NYC when you open up the Uber app, and try to get a car it just works. To get people to start using Gotham Air, it has to work the first time you try it. This is the biggest place they missed the mark. First I wanted to see if I could use Gotham Air _from_ JFK to Manhattan (no such luck). Then, when I tried to go the other way, my flight was canceled. 
* **Have some daily flights** -
