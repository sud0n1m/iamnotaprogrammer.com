The average home when Windows XP came out had physical photo albums, books, storage racks for DVDs and CDs, video game boxes. People cherished these physical objects. Then we realized it was the content more than the medium that was valuable.

Many of us have stopped producing physical memories. We are in the process of digitizing all of these things and throwing away or packing in to boxes their physical forms.

Content made by someone else -- like your books, movies, and music -- has become easy to access in a digital world, and the trend there is away from owned physical media to a "pay for access" model pioneered by companies like Netflix and Spotify. Services like these offer compelling access to content without requiring you to maintain physical or digital storage to use them.  

Want to watch a movie? Netflix, iTunes and Amazon Instant Video have many for either a rental fee or a monthly access fee. Want to listen to the new alt-J album? Pop open Spotify and you can. With a reliable internet connection there's a lifetime of music to listen to and movies to watch. 

The question I've found harder to answer (especially for less technical people), is how to manage all of these files you create. The scope of the problem changes quite dramatically depending on how much you create. It manifests in two ways: 1. An access problem: You can't get to all of your things in the same place. or 2. A storage problem: You can't store all of your things in the same place.

## Your smartphone can contain all your data 

Let's first define the problem in a simple way. Assume you have 2gb of photos and 1gb of documents that you've created over the years. You have a smartphone with 64gb of storage and a computer with 256gb of storage. 

You can store everything you've ever created on the smartphone with duplicates on the computer. Then you can back up the smartphone in full to the computer and still have space to spare. 

On top of this backup, you also probably want to use a service like Dropbox or Google Drive to automatically sync everything to the cloud. 

If your digital life can fit on to the device you with the lowest amount of storage, you should have no backup or access problem. 

## You have more data than can fit on your smart phone

Ok, so here comes the next challenge. Let's say you have a smaller capacity smart phone. You can only fit the most recent 6 months of photos. 

If you have a computer, every few weeks you can move photos to your computer and delete them from your phone. You might not put all of your personal files on the smart phone either. Each time you run out of space, you move pictures over and delete them.

Your files get automatically synced to Dropbox or Google Drive and they're safely in the cloud.

## You have more data than can fit on your computer

This has been the bucket I've been in for a while. Most photos taken on a DSLR never make it on to the smart phone. Anything taken on the smart phone gets synced to the computer. 

But what happens when the computer gets full? 

Dropbox or Google Drive? Well, not quite. Everything in the cloud gets synced locally by default. Yes, it's possible to not sync certain directories, but it makes using those files challenging. 

And, there's no way that my mom could conceivably manage the complex configuration of Dropbox and iPhoto to archive older photos and store them in the cloud, but not on her computer.

External hard drives might be a reasonable solution here. I've had a Synology DS212 NAS to store files I don't want on my hard drive all the time like old photos. Physical solutions like this are prone to fire. Imagine your house burned down with your computer and your NAS. We should be able to do a little better than physical photo albums and rolls of film. 

## What the future should look like

The average person is not going to manage a NAS device on their local network. They shouldn't be thinking about backup strategies or running out of storage space for their photos on their phone or computer.

Here are some of the rules for what will help the average person manage their digital lives.

### If you take a picture on your phone, it should be immediately uploaded to in the cloud

I believe both Apple's iOS and Google's Android do this today. However, Apple only has a limited number of photos in your photo stream. 

### Photo software like iPhoto should auto-archive to the cloud

Apple might automatically maintain a limited size local cache of your photos on your computer. Maybe the past 6 months or something like that. 

Older photos are automatically (or easily) moved in their full size to the cloud. A smaller version of the photo is maintained locally and automatically downloaded on request. 

### Your full online photo library is searchable and browsable

From any device, mobile, desktop or web you should be able to search every photo you've taken or browse through your most recent snapshots. All photos are easily downloadable to your local machine.

## The closest thing to this today

I'm really happy to say that this almost exists today. I set my mom up on
