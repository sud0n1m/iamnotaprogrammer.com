On January 1st, 2014, Diana was our first remote hire. She is based in Vancouver, WA and had been working with us on a trial for a month already. The first time we met in person was mid-December when she came to New York. 

On January 1st, 2014, John, my CTO and co-founder left New York City and has been traveling the world since. We had the opportunity to get the whole team together in Barcelona for a week and it was a great time to reflect and adjust our strategy.

It was eventful to say the least:
:
* One person had to fly home early with an emergency.
* A new hire never got on his flight to Barcelona (and we haven't heard from him since).

After the week with the team, I stuck around for another week. John and I hadn't been in the same room for 3 months, and spending time walking around and casually talking enabled us to think through and plan some resolutions to some issues we've been having.

Our business has three risks at the moment:



* We decided to let someone on the team go.
* We contracted with an ember.js dev shop
* We decided not to move forward with another hire.
