A lot of people have a morning coffee ritual. Mine starts after a walk to the office. It's probably drizzly in Portland on the walk. 

Unlock the door. Flick the lights on. 

Old water in the electric kettle goes down the sink. New water goes in to the kettle out of the tap. Flick on the kettle. The light illuminates to tell you it is heating the water.

Pull out the scale. The cover comes off, and the red button turns it on. 

Two buttons on the side of the coffee jar to slide the lid up. Flip it upside down on the scale. The scale is reset to zero. 

26 grams of coffee get measured, and then poured in to the coffee grinder. Buttons on the lid get pushed in and air gets pushed out as the lid slides back on to the container to preserve coffee for the next session.

The grinder is turned on and the smell of warm fresh grounds start to seep out. The grinder sputters and then the tune changes to a clean sound. There are no more beans in the grinder. Turn it off. 

A new cup comes out of the cupboard and lands on the scale. The filter comes out of the drawer and is folded at the seam then put in to the Hario V60. The V60 goes on top of the cup and the package sits neatly on the scale. 
The kettle starts to bubble. The button flicks itself off. The water is ready.

Water is poured out cleansing the filtered paper and warming the cup. Half turn the cup to saturate the other side.

Pour the water out of the cup. Pour the grounds in to the center of the filter. Reset the scale to zero. 

40 grams of water flows out of the narrow spout in a semi-circular motion. Let the coffee bubble and froth. 

300 more grams for 340 grams total. Let the water flow through.

Dump the grounds and filter in to the trash. Splash water on the V60 and in to the drying rack it goes. Put the scale away, and add a splash of milk. 

Sit down at the computer and start the day.
