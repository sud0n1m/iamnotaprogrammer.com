A couple of years ago, my friend Ryan and I figured out an inexpensive Ikea solution to try out standing. 2 years later, thousands of people have built the desk and it has been featured by Wired, the New York Times and many other places.

At home, we have the $22 standing desk set up, but at work, fortunately our business is doing OK so we had money to spend on office equipment. 

With a little more money to spend, what is the best _bang for your buck_ standing desk setup that you can create?

## My goals

* Easier switching from sitting to standing
* Standing ergonomics as good as the $22 standing desk or better
* Sitting ergonomics as good as possible
* Good looks
* The low cost solution for maximum function

## The best bang for your buck standing desk setup

With that in mind, let's get started. 

### Frame

**xxxxxxxx frame $590**

When browsing for office furniture, I saw a frame at a local Portland vendor for $590 without a top. With many of the online retailers, the hidden cost is usually a $100 shipping charge. In this case, it was $590 to my door.

Additionally, the motorized desk had a display which tells you the height of the desk and 3 presets. 

I stored my ideal heights for sitting and for standing and use the presets all the time to adjust the desk height. I'd highly recommend getting a desk frame with presets. 

### Top

**Ikea Bekant Birch Table $90**

Ikea is getting rid of the Galant series and replacing it with Bekant. We bought a more few non-standing desks from Ikea so having matching tops makes things easy. One issue we ran in to is that the Bekant top is quite thin. The screws from the frame are a little too long. They didn't pop through, but in a few places the desks have bumps. Our thought was to later replace the tops with a nice wood top.

### Monitor

**Apple Thunderbolt Display $850 refurbished**

I only mention the display because it is specific to the monitor arm below. Directly on the table, these monitors are not adjustable. 

### Monitor Arm

**Ergo Monitor Arm $90**

Most monitor arms for 

### Anti-fatigue mat

**Newlife Biofoam factory second $45**

I bought 3 of these anti-fatigue mats online a few years ago. There was a factory second on the black ones due to discoloration, but we were very happy to take them. 

### Chair

**Steelcase Leap $900**

This one might get some ire from you guys. Yes, the steelcase leap is more expensive than the rest of the set up. However, it is the nicest office chair I've ever used without a doubt. Configured correctly, the chair gives you amazing support in all the right places. 

### Other Accessories

* Wrist rest
* Gel Mousepad
